If you're familiar with Python, you can install Material for MkDocs with pip , the Python package manager. If not, we recommended using docker . Installation with pip recommended Material for MkDocs is published as a Python package and can be installed with pip , ideally by using a virtual environment . If not, scroll down and expand the help box. Install with: === \"Latest\" ``` sh pip install mkdocs-material ``` === \"8.x\" ``` sh pip install mkdocs-material==\"8.*\" # (1)! ``` 1. Material for MkDocs uses [semantic versioning][^1], which is why it's a good idea to limit upgrades to the current major version. This will make sure that you don't accidentally [upgrade to the next major version], which may include breaking changes that silently break your site. Additionally, you can use `pip freeze` to create a lockfile, so builds are reproducible at all times: ``` pip freeze > requirements.txt ``` Now, the lockfile can be used for installation: ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ``` [^1]: Note that improvements of existing features are sometimes released as patch releases, like for example improved rendering of content tabs, as they're not considered to be new features. This will automatically install compatible versions of all dependencies: MkDocs , Markdown , Pygments and Python Markdown Extensions . Material for MkDocs always strives to support the latest versions, so there's no need to install those packages separately. Tip : If you don't have prior experience with Python, we recommend reading Using Python's pip to Manage Your Projects' Dependencies , which is a really good introduction on the mechanics of Python package management and helps you troubleshoot if you run into errors. with docker The official Docker image is a great way to get up and running in a few minutes, as it comes with all dependencies pre-installed. Pull the image for the latest version with: === \"Latest\" ``` docker pull squidfunk/mkdocs-material ``` === \"8.x\" ``` docker pull squidfunk/mkdocs-material:8 ``` The mkdocs executable is provided as an entry point and serve is the default command. If you're not familiar with Docker don't worry, we have you covered in the following sections. The following plugins are bundled with the Docker image: mkdocs-minify-plugin mkdocs-redirects How to add plugins to the Docker image? Material for MkDocs only bundles selected plugins in order to keep the size of the official image small. If the plugin you want to use is not included, create a new Dockerfile and extend the official Docker image: FROM squidfunk/mkdocs-material RUN pip install ... Next, you can build the image with the following command: docker build -t squidfunk/mkdocs-material . The new image can be used exactly like the official image. Apple Silicon (M1) and Raspberry Pi The official Docker image is only available for linux/amd64 . We recommend the third-party image by @afritzler if you want to run Material for MkDocs via Docker on arm64 or armv7 , as it is automatically built on every release: docker pull ghcr.io/afritzler/mkdocs-material with git Material for MkDocs can be directly used from GitHub by cloning the repository into a subfolder of your project root which might be useful if you want to use the very latest version: git clone https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material.git The theme will reside in the folder mkdocs-material/material .

Creating & managing teams is extremely simple and this guide will run you down on how to do it. Creating a Team Start of by navigating to the teams page, once you're there you'll see a button labeled: \"Create Team\". Once you've pressed that, a menu will appear asking you to provide a name and description for the team, this data will be used so that you can identify it. Once you've inputted the information, click the \"Create Team\" button at the bottom of the menu and you'll see it appear on the page, from which you'll be able to manage or delete it. Managing a Team Once you have a team created, you'll be able to manage it by clicking the \"Manage\" button. A new page will appear where you can edit the name & description as well as add \"ranks\". Ranks allow you to granually control specific actions users can do on servers where the team is added. Ranks work similar to Discord roles and can be assigned to certain users depending on how much control you want them to have over your server. To create a rank , click the \"Create Rank\" button. A menu will appear asking you to provide a name and select what permissions users with that rank should have. Creating a rank is pretty self explanatory, but if you get stuck you can use one of our methods of support for further guidance. To add a new member , click the \"Add Member\" button. A menu will appear and it will ask you to input the email address of the user you want to add. Once you've done that, select which rank the user should have upon being added (you can change this later). For your information, the user does not need to have an account created on our panel. Once you add their email address, they'll receive all the information they need for setting up an account on our panel.","title":"Teams"},{"location":"sections/using-the-panel/teams/#teams","text":"A new & exciting feature of our custom panel is the ability to easily control groups of sub-users, we call these groups \"Teams\".

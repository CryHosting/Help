# Teams
*A new & exciting feature of our custom panel is the ability to easily control groups of sub-users, we call these groups "Teams". Creating & managing teams is extremely simple and this guide will run you down on how to do it.*

###  Creating a Team
Start of by navigating to the teams page, once you're there you'll see a button labeled: "Create Team". Once you've pressed that, a menu will appear asking you to provide a name and description for the team, this data will be used so that you can identify it. Once you've inputted the information, click the "Create Team" button at the bottom of the menu and you'll see it appear on the page, from which you'll be able to manage or delete it.

###  Managing a Team
Once you have a team created, you'll be able to manage it by clicking the "Manage" button. A new page will appear where you can edit the name & description as well as add "ranks". Ranks allow you to granually control specific actions users can do on servers where the team is added. Ranks work similar to Discord roles and can be assigned to certain users depending on how much control you want them to have over your server.

**To create a rank**, click the "Create Rank" button. A menu will appear asking you to provide a name and select what permissions users with that rank should have. Creating a rank is pretty self explanatory, but if you get stuck you can use one of our [methods of support](/support) for further guidance.

**To add a new member**, click the "Add Member" button. A menu will appear and it will ask you to input the email address of the user you want to add. Once you've done that, select which rank the user should have upon being added (you can change this later). For your information, the user does not need to have an account created on our panel. Once you add their email address, they'll receive all the information they need for setting up an account on our panel.
